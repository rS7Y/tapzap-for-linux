# Changelog

Changes to the Linux source repository are recorded here. Website ZIPs that
predate the public source snapshot are not treated as releases of this source.

## Unreleased

- Format project C/C++ and Python consistently without changing application
  behavior; preserve backend boundaries and upstream assets.
- Add a code map, CLI reference, and `make` commands for development checks.
- Add full-history secret scanning and pinned formatter checks to CI.
- Publish the Linux-only source tree, build notes, support boundaries, and
  third-party notices under GPL-3.0-or-later.
- Keep all five backend variants experimental while the recovery and reliability
  findings in [known issues](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md) remain open.
- No binary release is included or claimed to match this source revision.
